Apparently these groups don’t get along. You can definitely add Security Admins & Business Users to that list. The reasons are (sort of) obvious, but only if you point them out. Simply put, one group restricts access and the other group demands access. I understand this is an over-simplification. At the end of the day, if user or corporate data is compromised, everyone gets upset. However, from a tactical standpoint, these two groups are trying to accomplish goals simultaneously and inevitably get in each other’s way.



The friction between business users and security policies typically occurs during the authentication process. For example, when a user is asked to enter login credentials or go through an MFA challenge. While this may seem innocuous, it should be noted that friction (over time) builds and builds – and if a user does not see the benefits in the extra authentication step(s), they are likely to abandon whatever business transaction they’re trying to access. And, abandonment certainly does not promote productivity!

**…and, here in lies the true conflict between security and productivity**

Securing data that resides in ERP applications has all the makings of a classic conflict between security and business user productivity. All the security focus is on login screen authentication – and traditional, on-premise ERP applications (SAP, PeopleSoft, Oracle EBS) are filled with sensitive data with limited ways to implement fine-grained controls. The result is Security Admins have no choice but to be overly-strict with their security policies (ex. requiring MFA at each login) – causing users to push back and possibly abandon critical business transactions.
